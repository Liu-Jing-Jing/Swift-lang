# Swift-lang


- 17 Jul 2010 First Commit 

**Welcome to Swift!**

Swift is a new, high performance systems programming language.  It has a clean
and modern syntax, and offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code
and frameworks, and is memory safe (by default).

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a
C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core
features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level
constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics.  Swift embraces
modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.


## Documentation

To read the documentation, start by installing the Sphinx documentation
generator tool (http://sphinx-doc.org, just run `easy_install -U Sphinx` from
the command line and you're good to go).  Once you have that, you can build the
swift documentation by going into `swift/docs` and typing `make`.  This compiles
the 'rst' files in the docs directory into HTML in the `swift/docs/_build/html`
directory.

Once built, the best place to start is with the swift whitepaper, which gives a
tour of the language (in `swift/docs/_build/html/whitepaper/index.html`).
Another potentially useful document is `docs/LangRef`, which gives a low level
tour of how the language works from the implementation perspective.

Many of the docs are out of date, but you can see some historical design
documents in the `docs` directory.

Another source of documentation is the standard library itself, located at
`swift/stdlib`.  Much of the language is actually implemented in the library
(including `Int`), and the standard library gives some examples of what can be
expressed today.


## Getting Started

These instructions give the most direct path to a working Swift
development environment.  Options for doing things differently are
discussed below.


### System Requirements

OS X, Ubuntu Linux LTS, and the latest Ubuntu Linux release are the current
supported host development operating systems.

[CMake](http://cmake.org) is used to build Swift and its companion projects; at
least version 2.8.12.2 is required.

For OS X, you need [the latest Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).

For Ubuntu, you'll need the following development dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install git cmake ninja clang uuid-dev libicu-dev libbsd-dev libedit-dev swig libpython-dev libncurses5-dev

Note: LLDB currently requires at least swig-1.3.40 but will successfully build
with version 2 shipped with Ubuntu.


### Getting Sources for Swift and Related Projects

      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift.git
      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift-llvm.git
      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift-clang.git
      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift-lldb.git
      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift-cmark.git
      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift-llbuild.git
      git clone git@github.com:/apple/swift-package-manager.git


### Building Swift

    swift/utils/build-script -t

Note: Arguments after "--" above are forwarded build-script-impl, which is
invoked by build-script.  [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/), is the
current recommended cross-platform build system for building Swift. It's the
default if you have it installed or have it checked out next to the swift
directory.

       swift/utils/build-script -m -t -- --build-args=-j8

## Build and Test Options

The `build-script` has lots of useful options, including the ability to build an
LLDB that's compatible with the Swift in your working copy.  To find out more:

    swift/utils/build-script -h

To get verbose output, pass `--build-args="VERBOSE=1"`


## Develop Swift in Xcode

The Xcode IDE can be used to edit the Swift source code, but it is not currently
fully supported as a build environment for SDKs other than OS X. If you'd like
to build for other SDKs but still use Xcode, once you've built Swift using Ninja
or one of the other supported CMake generators, you can set up an IDE-only Xcode
environment using the build-script's `-X` flag:

    swift/utils/build-script -X --skip-build -- --llvm-config=$HOME/build/swift/Ninja-DebugAssert/llvm-macosx-x86_64/bin/llvm-config

The `--skip-build` parameter tells build-script to only generate the project,
not build it, and the `--llvm-config` parameter allows the Xcode project to
share the LLVM build products and environment with Ninja.

## Testing Swift

See docs/Testing.rst.
